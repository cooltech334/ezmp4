# ezmp4
Fast and easy youtube to mp4 generator made with python.
# Why use ezmp4?
If you see this, you might be wondering: Why use this program when there are many free online ones.  
Well, atleast in my experience, these are either:  
a, painfully slow  
b, filled with ads containing malware  
c, fake and containing ads filled with malware.  
For the reasons above, I created my own, which is fast, free, and has 0 ads.  
Using this also removes all ads from the video and allows you to access it offline, both of which normally require a mobile phone and/or a youtube premium subscription.
# How to use
It is fairly simple to use this. Although it is CLI based, meaning it runs in a terminal, it is not too different from a regular app.  
Just download either the mac or windows version, and follow the prompts!  
# For developers
I have also uploaded the raw python file. If you would like to expand on this, please give me credit (cooltech334).
